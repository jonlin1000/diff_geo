\title{Topology Prereqs}

\maketitle

This document details most of the topology prereqs that one should have before starting differential geometry. Or one can reference facts and theorems when they need them. The definition of a manifold is intricately tied to topology, however, so it is wise to refresh the memory here. As of today, most of this document is based off chapter 1 of Kelley's General Topology.
