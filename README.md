all about geometry

In this repo are my attempts to understand the broad subject of geometry. I will list sources here that I pulled material I learn from.
- Knill, Geometric Analysis Notes
- Artin, Algebra (sections on geometry)
- Janich, Vector Analysis
- Edwards, Calculus of Several Variables
etc
